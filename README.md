Helping Louise - Performing analysis on Kickstarter Data to uncover trends

## Overview of The Project
Given data with specific dates, budgets and outcomes from diffent projects, we are being able to summarize and visualize the data for Louise to make decisions regarding her interests. You will be able to see results on specific categorizations with tables, charts, trends, and their visualization. 

You will be able to envision the relationship between the interests between countries, their successful rate, outcomes and more results making reference between the categories and subcategories, such as technology, games, music, theather, plays and many more.  

Luoise had interest especially in the US and GB markets regarding:
- Parent Categories
- SubCategories 
- Outcomes
- Launch Dates

As an example we can se in the next images the outcomes of all projects based on their launch date:

As well, in this image we can see the Parent Category Outcomes we have related to the diverse activities:

Behind the request and the Excel, we could notice that Louise was inclined towards Plays and Theather and their outcomes in the main countries as mentioned. 

There would be a recommendation to look more closely to the US market, since the final outcomes for the succesfull and failed rates have a reasonable trend that could be un the interest if analyzing the data. 

Also it would be a good idea to look closely to the launch dates, since according to the chart above, the best months to launch projects would be during the first five months of the year.
