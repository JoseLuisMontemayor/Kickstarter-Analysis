Helping Louise - Performing analysis on Kickstarter Data to uncover trends

## Overview of The Project
With the given data with specific dates, budgets and outcomes from diffent projects, we are being able to summarize and visualize the data for Louise to make decisions regarding her interests. You will be able to see results on specific categorizations with tables, charts, trends, and their visualization. 

**What type of projects are there?** 

You will be able to envision the relationship between the interests between countries, their successful rate, outcomes and more results making reference between the categories and subcategories, such as technology, games, music, theather, plays and many more. It is an interesting analysis is you´re looking to explore diverse projects with different ramifications and see their relationship regarding several factors to take into account. 

## Analysis and Challenges

Luoise had interest especially in the US and GB markets regarding:
- Parent Categories
- SubCategories 
- Outcomes
- Launch Dates

As an example we can se in the next images the outcomes of all projects based on their launch date:

As well, in this image we can see the Parent Category Outcomes we have related to the diverse activities:

In the next line chart we can see the relationship between the goals and their outcomes regarding certain levels of amounts. As we can see the most successful outcomes come for the ones below a $1,000 budget and from $35,000 to $44,999. These details are important to take into account when finding an amount to put as a goal.

As mentioned before, Louise had an interest on Launch dates on specific subcategories, such as Theather. We may see that the best month to have a successful Theather launch would be on may, regarding the next 3 months would have a decline, they could be still be considered as strong months. Also, its is needed to take into account that the trend for failed launches shows a similar pace but in a lower scale. When it comes into making decisions this needs to be taken into account.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
To start making an analysis with all the data, it is important to understand and think what do we need as outcomes. As the challenge went by, I could understand the certain data that was shown in different format (Such as dates), with the given formulas. It was a challenge to see the details of charts and their manipulation, since in several cases the information wasn´t visualized as the way expected. It was a good way to understand the features of the specific tools used since you had to explore it´s options to maintain an order and a good visual. Poeple may encounter more problems in the manipulation of charts, since they have a quite good amount of attributes. 

# Results

### Theather Outcomes by Launch Date
Based in the Analysis regarding the outcomes for the Theathers Launch date, it is true that the most similar tendencies are the successful and failed outcomes. Canceled and live don´t show that much relevant data as the other 2 mentioned before, since both are incomplete and in the case of the canceled, the shown trend doesn´t vary that much along the year and there wouldn´t be much to analyze. 

Louise would want to look closely the first 2 mentioned, we can see in the successful trend that there is an increase since from March through May, and from then, the tendency looks negative but yet, with good outcome numbers. It is evident that the best time to launch Theathers dates would be between March and August if we go according to this analysis. As mentioned, the failure results keep a similar trend as the successful, but in a much lower scale, so the probabilities if having a good project seem to succeed. 

### Outcomes Based on Goals
In terms of the subcategory of plays, we can see the whole analysis of the data of how it behaves regarding their interval outcomes and goals. Both line trends show that they have an opposite behavior, when one increases the other decreases and vice versa. The strongest budgets for successful plays are the ones less than 1,000, between 1,000 and 4,999, and from between 35,000 and 44,999. Other points the regarding the increasements in failed plays, include the reduction of the ones successful, for example the interval from 20,000 to 34,999. Its is important to look closely not from the budgets that Louise disposes, but the budgets she can create per play regarding the total amount. 

### Summary & Recomendations
As we viewed the dataset for the first time, it could be noticed that the data was pretty raw, there was no minimum separation of categories and subcategories even that if they were so different. The dates had t be translated, but regarding this, it was our job to create an analysis regarding Louise´s interests. We could see that she that the outcomes and their launch dates were important to her, also considering budgets. In a more profound analysis, we could combine the one or several subcategories, with their respective launch dates, outcomes and budgets, if it were to be looked more deeply. With this file you can be very specific, especially using the CountIfs function, which would facilitate findings and filtering. It can be considered a goof base to start a visual.
