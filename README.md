Helping Louise - Performing analysis on Kickstarter Data to uncover trends

With this analysis we are being able to see the relationship of several countries regarding budgets, outcomes, deadlines and more information with reference to several categories such as technology, games, music, theather and many more.  

Luoise had interest especially in the US and GB markets regarding:
- Parent Categories
- SubCategories 
- Outcomes
- Launch Dates

As an example we can se in the next images the outcomes of all projects based on their launch date:

As well, in this image we can see the Parent Category Outcomes we have related to the diverse activities:

Behind the request and the Excel, we could notice that Louise was inclined towards Plays and Theather and their outcomes in the main countries as mentioned. 
There would be a recommendation to look more closely to the US market, since the final outcomes for the succesfull and failed rates have a reasonable trend that could be un the interest if analyzing the data.
