Helping Louise - Performing analysis on Kickstarter Data to uncover trends

## Overview of The Project
With the given data with specific dates, budgets and outcomes from diffent projects, we are being able to summarize and visualize the data for Louise to make decisions regarding her interests. You will be able to see results on specific categorizations with tables, charts, trends, and their visualization. 

**What type of projects are there?** 

You will be able to envision the relationship between the interests between countries, their successful rate, outcomes and more results making reference between the categories and subcategories, such as technology, games, music, theather, plays and many more. It is an interesting analysis is youÂ´re looking to explore diverse projects with different ramifications and see their relationship regarding several factors to take into account. 

## Analysis and Challenges

Luoise had interest especially in the US and GB markets regarding:
- Parent Categories
- SubCategories 
- Outcomes
- Launch Dates

As an example we can se in the next images the outcomes of all projects based on their launch date:

As well, in this image we can see the Parent Category Outcomes we have related to the diverse activities:

In the next line chart we can see the relationship between the goals and their outcomes regarding certain levels of amounts. As we can see the most successful outcomes come for the ones below a $1,000 budget and from $35,000 to $44,999. These details are important to take into account when finding an amount to put as a goal.

As mentioned before, Louise had an interest on Launch dates on specific subcategories, such as Theather. We may see that the best month to have a successful Theather launch would be on may, regarding the next 3 months would have a decline, they could be still be considered as strong months. Also, its is needed to take into account that the trend for failed launches shows a similar pace but in a lower scale. When it comes into making decisions this needs to be taken into account.

Behind the request and the Excel, we could notice that Louise was inclined towards Plays and Theather and their outcomes in the main countries as mentioned. 

There would be a recommendation to look more closely to the US market, since the final outcomes for the succesfull and failed rates have a reasonable trend that could be un the interest if analyzing the data. 

Also it would be a good idea to look closely to the launch dates, since according to the chart above, the best months to launch projects would be during the first five months of the year.
